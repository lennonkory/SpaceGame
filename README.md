About:

Project-Descent is a first-person space shooter influenced by the 1994 video game Descent, which was completed for
CIS*3760 Software Engineering. The player controls a spaceship and must complete 5 levels. Along the way the player
can pick up power ups to gain ammo, health, armour and new weapons.
In each level, the player must complete an objective. Objectives are: 
Kill all the enemies, find the ball, and defeat the boss(the final level).

Primary weapons are fast but tend to be weak. There are bullets, small missiles(some that do fire damage) and a laser.
Secondary weapons are slow but do a lot more damage. They are big missiles and bombs.
The best combo to use is the laser and the homing missile!
